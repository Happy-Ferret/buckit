This script does two things:

- Sets up buckconfig files with proper cells for each third-party
  project installed by yarn
- Builds third party packages that do not yet support Buck and
  creates BUCK files for each project

See ./buckit.py --help for usage

Sources are added with yarn, and installed to node_modules
Compiler settings are taken from .buckconfig

Better documentation coming
